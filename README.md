# hand-gesture-recognition
The Hand Gesture Recognition project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and classify hand gestures in real-time using a camera. It is capable of identifying gestures such as rock, pointing, scissors, and waving. This technology opens possibilities for intuitive human-computer interaction in various applications, including gaming, augmented reality interfaces, and assistive technologies.

To run the Hand Gesture Recognition system on a Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

Step 01: Setup and Installation:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install Jupyter Notebook and the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install jupyter numpy opencv-python
pip install numpy


Step 02: Start Jupyter Notebook:
